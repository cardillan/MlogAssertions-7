# MlogAssertions

> [!TIP]
> This mod supports Mindustry 7.

Mod for making debugging in Mindustry Logic a bit easier. Provided functionality:

* Buttons to copy the variables (including their full, unrounded values) and the processor's text buffer to clipboard. The variables can be pasted into a spreadsheet and sorted by name for easier inspection.
* Custom mlog instruction for enhanced runtime checks in Mindustry Logic. (This instruction is generated by [Mindcode](https://github.com/cardillan/mindcode) for runtime checks.)

The mod is still under development. The precise specification of instructions may still change.
